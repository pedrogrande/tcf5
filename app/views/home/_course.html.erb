		      <p>Our <b>twelve week program</b> covers the most important aspects of application design and development. From object-oriented programming and database management like <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b>, to front-end technologies such as <b>HTML5/CSS3</b> and <b>Javascript</b>.</p>

					<p>Learning about web development is much more than learning how to code. Along with teaching you the basic building blocks of web development we teach you how to <b>think like a programmer</b>. We show you the motivations behind good software design and best-practices, data structures, and code readings.</p>
