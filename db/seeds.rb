#   {id: 1, title: "Everything you need to know about Heartbleed", lead: "Even after three weeks we are still being contacted by people about the Heartbleed bug. This is why we decided to create this comprehensive article that will leave no question unanswered.", content: "<h3>A story of heartbeats</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>About three weeks ago a major flaw in the open source SSL software created a hitherto unknown outcry not only in tech savvy but also in mainstream media. But what exactly is Heartbleed apart from being the first bug with a beautiful logo? The Coder Factory tells you everything you need to know about Heartbleed and what actions you should take.</p>\r\n<h3>What happened?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 21st Neel Mehta of Google Security discovered the vulnerability in the SSL certificate. Google then created a patch to fix the problem and applied it progressively to its services. On April the 1st the Open SSL team was notified and a patch was then applied to fix the software which in its latest version 1.0.1g. is immune for attacks trying to exploit the bug. On April the 7th most of the world found out about Heartbleed which by that time got a pretty little website run by the Finish IT security firm Codenomicon that discovered the bug separately to Mehta on April the 2nd. What followed was an intensive coverage of Heartbleed in almost every publication.</p>\r\nWhat is Heartbleed?\r\n\r\nHeartbleed is a tiny little bug in the OpenSSL TLS (Transport Layer Security) ‘heartbeat’ mechanism. TLS is a protocol that is used to secure communication between web services, by exchanging a symmetric key. The logic behind this is pretty much similar to your Bluetooth encryption. Only if you insert a specified key, your devices will connect (attention: oversimplification!!). The Heartbeat mechanism is nothing more than a periodic signal that ensures the key is valid. The bug in this mechanism is a missing bounds check that can be used to fetch data from a server. In normal use the heartbeat request sends a message with a payload, typically a text string along with the payloads length. The receiving server must then send the exact same payload back to ensure encryption. The missing bounds check allows attackers to extend the length of the request, permitting them to receive a much longer response containing the text string but also whatever 496 characters (in case of a 4 character string) happened to be in the server memory before. That could be completely useless data but it could also contain master keys, passwords, and usernames which then could be used to attain further data such as credit card information.\r\n\r\nAll this wouldn’t be worth discussing if this was an isolated bug that only appeared on your mums online shop for handmade socks. But the adoption of OpenSSL is estimated to be two thirds of the servers currently on the internet. Among the affected websites were Eventbrite, OKCupid and even the website of the FBI. The online magazine Ars Technica points out that OpenSSL is “by far the Internet’s most popular open-source cryptographic library and TLS implementation”.\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n\r\nFirst of all change your passwords! No one knows on which scale the bug has been exploited so changing your passwords is a necessary precaution all of us should take. There are various tools out there that are supposed to detect if the site is affected one of them being AppCheck by Codenomicon. If you are an administrator or webmaster you should already have applied the patch. Reissue your SSL certificates and urge users to change their passwords!\r\n", image: "http://s12.postimg.org/r8fi5wtwt/heartbleed.png", user_id: 1, category_id: 1, slug: "Everything-Need-Know-About-Heartbleed", created_at: "2014-05-05 13:57:01", updated_at: "2014-06-02 04:03:16", publish: true, published_date: "2014-05-04"},
#   {id: 2, title: "The ABC of Code", lead: "Ever wondered if there is a blog article out there that tells you everything (yes everything!!) you ever need to know? Wonder no more, here is the ABC of code.", content: "<p><strong>A - Angular.JS</strong> is what HTML would have been, had it been designed to build web-apps. It is an open source web application framework maintained by Google and it’s community. The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to better serve dynamic content. Angular.js follows the Model-View-Controller pattern of software engineering. The most notable feature of Angular.js is its two way data binding which reduces the amount of code you have to write significantly. The Coder Factory offers Australias first Angular.js course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B - Bootstrap</strong> is a framework for front-end development of responsive sleek looking mobile first web applications. It contains HTML and CSS based templates for typography, buttons, forms and general interface components. Basically, Bootstrap is a very easy and fast way to give your app a sleek, well designed look. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C - CSS</strong>, short for Cascading Style Sheet is a language to describe the look and formatting written in a markup language such as HTML. Primarily it is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation in a document. Almost every website in the world uses CSS to describe their presentation, so you should definitely have a look into it. Of course you will learn in our courses about this integral part as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D - DRY</strong> for don’t repeat yourself. Remember that sales guy who told you the same thing five times, packaged in different words? Didn’t feel good, did it? DRY is a principle in software development aimed at reducing repetition of information of any kind. If you apply this principle throughout every piece of code you write, the modification of a single element won’t prompt you to change an element in a logically unrelated part of your code. Pretty cool, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>E</strong> - Every code should be <strong>elegant</strong>. This goes back to the mindset that programming is art. There are people who will ask you “why write elegant code if you can write effective code?”. However, we think that elegance serves this purpose much better since it leads to more concise and maintainable code. You should always remember that code is read more than written. You don’t want to make your code a black box that will take your colleagues a lifetime to figure out. So take a little time, make it pretty!\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>F - Flash</strong> was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, graphics and rich internet applications. Most likely the last movie you illegally streamed on a sketchy site was delivered to you by Adobe flash player. Although blamed to be quite resource consuming and insecure it is still used on many websites. You probably heard about Steve Jobs refusing to use Flash on Apple devices. If it really was for the named shortcomings or his personal quarrels with Adobe we will probably never find out. Although HTML5 is predicted to replace Flash in no time, it is still worth having a look into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>G - Github</strong> is every coders best friend (apart from caffeine). With over 11.5 million repositories it is the largest host of code in the world. Github contains social networking features to allow developers to collaborate on their projects which makes it invaluable for maintaining open source software as well as private projects. Github offers free and paid plans, just select what you need. Fun fact: Github is built with Ruby on Rails, the framework The Coder Factory teaches you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>H - Hydra code</strong> is a piece of code that cannot be fixed. Like the ancient Greek monster it sprouts two heads for every head that Hercules would cut off. Code that behaves like this will introduce at least two more bugs for every bug you fix. You won’t have another choice than to rewrite the whole code. Sorry bro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I - Graphic User Interface</strong>, well it’s kind of self explaining. This is everything you see and interact with. The first GUI was invented at Stanford Research Institute and further developed by Xerox PARC. After visiting Xerox, Steve Jobs used the technology first in the Apple Lisa and then in the Macintosh, which was revolutionary back then. After Bill Gates released Windows GUI this funny conversation happened: Steve:\"You’re stealing from us!” Bill replied \"I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>J - Javascript</strong> is a dynamic (mostly client side) programming language that allows you to update content on your webpage without refreshing the page. While Angular.js is a pretty cool framework, JavaScript is the foundation it is built on. It was originally developed at Netscape to battle Microsoft in the browser wars. We teach Javascript in our advanced app development courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://s28.postimg.org/qg4bwfzjh/Knuth.png\">\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><strong>K  - Donald Knuth</strong> is the author of “The Art of Computer Programming” one of our favourite books, so we just couldn’t leave him out of this list. He is a professor emeritus at Stanford University and considered to be the father of the analysis of algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>L - Libraries of code</strong> are collections of implementations of behaviour that has an interface by which the behaviour is invoked. Sounds complicated, hm? It basically means that the code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other. Then the user only needs to know the interface of the library and not the internal logic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>M - MongoDB</strong>, derived from humongous, is a cross platform document oriented database. Being a NoSQL database it uses JSON like dynamic schemes instead of traditional relational table based structures, which makes the integration of data in web apps a lot easier. MongoDB has been adopted by some of the major sites such as Ebay, Craigslist and even the New York Times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>N - Nopping</strong> is coder for zoning out. Derived from NOP (no-operation) it is napping in programming jargon. Everyone needs a break every now and then. Have a nop instead!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>O - Object oriented programming</strong> is a paradigm that represents the concept of objects that are described by attributes and altered by methods. Objects are usually instances of classes, design to interact with each other to design an application. Many of the major programming languages such as C++, Java, Ruby and PHP are object oriented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>P - Push based</strong> communication describes a request for an interaction that is initiated by the publisher, e.g. the server instead of a pull that comes from the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q - Quality of Code</strong> is a broad term and every programmer will have their own definition. We like to describe quality code as legible (the code clearly states the intent), testable, flexible (dependencies should be minimized), compliant (the code should comply with its requirements) and economical (the code should make reasonable use of its resources). Together this principle is known as LTFCE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>R - Ruby on Rails</strong> is a web development framework using Ruby as a language. It was developed by David Heinemeier-Hansson around 2005. It is a very streamlined framework since it makes a lot of decisions for you on how things should be organized and how things should be done. This allows you as a developer to focus on the functionality of your app instead of worrying about the unpleasant details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>S - Scaffolding</strong> is a technique used by Model-View-Controller frameworks (such as Ruby on Rails). With scaffolding a developer can specify a description of how a database might be used. This allows you to generate code that e.g. reads, creates or deletes database entries in a very streamlined way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T - Alan Turing</strong> is considered to be the patron saint of computer science, although never being officially being declared a saint (who cares?). Born in 1912 he is the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. His Turing Machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. It is considered the first model of an actual computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>U - Usability testing</strong> will be an important task before you go live with your app. Your code might be elegant, of high quality and non repetitive but if your usability is crap it is all in vain. You want to make your app as user friendly as possible, so people don’t get lost in buying your super cool new product, right? A common technique is A/B testing in which you introduce two different versions to different audiences and monitor the reactions. Whatever works best will be adapted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>V for View</strong>, Model, Controller (not necessarily in the right order) is a pattern for implementing user interfaces. The central component is the Model which contains application data, business logic rules and functions. The View is the actual output your users will see in their browsers. The Controller accepts input and converts it to commands for the Model or View.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>W - W3C</strong> (World Wide Web Consortium) is the main international standards organization for the web. Founded and led by Tim-Berners Lee, the inventor of the web, it is the guardian of the World Wide Web. It also has some pretty cool resources to learn code. Check out W3Schools!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>X - Experience</strong>. Many people think they can learn code and be done with it. The truth is: you will never stop learning as a developer. Technologies are changing rapidly and you will have to keep up to scratch throughout your career. Just another reason to take a Coder Factory course, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Y - Yoda condition</strong> is programming jargon for code where two parts of an expression are reversed from the typical order of in a conditional statement. Just like “learn to code you should, young padawan”. </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://s21.postimg.org/4c5r2dkvb/Zuse.png\">\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><strong>Z</strong> - Of course we couldn’t leave Konrad <strong>Zuse</strong> out of this comprehensive list. He was a German scientist who built the first programmable computer, the Turing-complete Z3. After WW2 IBM optioned his patents which was the first acknowledgement of his work outside Germany. You might also remember the character Zuse from “Tron - Legacy” who betrays Sam in order to gain control of the grid. This, of course, is reference to the legendary scientist.</p>\r\n", image: "http://s1.postimg.org/9boszi1xb/ABC_blog.png", user_id: 5, category_id: 1, slug: "Abc-Of-Code", created_at: "2014-06-02 05:14:30", updated_at: "2014-06-02 05:14:30", publish: true, published_date: "2014-05-11"},
